                <p>
                    Web development isn't only about coding but it is also about website designing. <br>
                    Before going into the process of development, i will have to start thinking about <br>
                    things like a webites layout, color, fonts and many more.This means that i can <br>
                    develop my designing skil. A good website has a clear quality design.

                    It can give me a way to contribute to the world. like having an idea in mind that can <br>
                    solve real world problems. It can help by creating solutions to it. As a web student <br>

            </li>
            <li><b>Earning Well From It</b>
                <p>
                    Everyone likes money, right? of course. It is among the best skills that i would <br>
                    earn money. I can work as a freelance web developer or work for an organization as <br>
                    a web developer. I can create my own start-up , do internships in start-ups, create <br>
                    my own blog, online store and many more and the best part is that i can do all <br>
                    these things from home.

            </li>
            <li><b>Teamwork skills</b>
                <p>
                    For a website to be successful all must work simultaneaously so that the website <br>
                    works efficiently and placidly. A successful website consists of front-end developers, <br>
                    back-end developers, testers etc. There has to be an open suggestion as well as feedback <br>
                    from fellow mates and need to meet the end before the deadline so that others don't lag <br>
                    With Teamwork i can learn, improve as well as strenghten my skills. The skills not only myself <br>
                    but as well as my teammates too. One of the aim is to build a team of like-minded people
